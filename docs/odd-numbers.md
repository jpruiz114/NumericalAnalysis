# Odd numbers

## Definition

An odd number is an integer which is not a multiple of two. If it is divided by two the result is a fraction. One is the first odd positive number. The next four bigger odd numbers are three, five, seven, and nine. So some sequential odd numbers are: {1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25...}
